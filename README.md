# exoplanetarchivefigs
Generate figures based on data from NASA's Exoplanet Archive

The code in this repository is a slightly repackaged version of the code used to make Figure 2.5 in the Astro2020 Decadal Survey final report (Pathways to Discovery in Astronomy and Astrophysics for the 2020s - https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/26141/chapter/4#40).  

To create your own versions of these figures, first clone or download a copy of this repository.  Then, in the top-level directory of the repository, run:

    pip install --user .
   
This will install the backend routines used in the example Jupyter notebook, along with all required python packages.  

Feel free to use/modify/redistribute figures based on this code in any way you wish, but please consider crediting this repository, and the NASA Exoplanet Archive (see here: https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/acknowledge.html).
